Calculate how much you and your partner should contribute towards shared expenses

To run locally, clone the repository and run:

npm install
```

Once all of the dependencies are installed, you can start the development server with:
```
npm run dev
```

This project uses Google Firebase's [Realtime Database](https://firebase.google.com/products/realtime-database/) and [Authentication](https://firebase.google.com/products/auth/) so you'll need to replace the [configuration](https://github.com/hursey013/budget-duo/blob/master/src/config.js#L9-L16) with your own credentials.
